# Wide2Long: Learning Lens-Compression and Perspective Adjustment for Wide-Angle to Telephoto Translation
## Image-Dataset repository for learning lens-compression parameters.
We are releasing the dataset for our work on learning lens-compression. Each image-data is a source-target pair in .jpg format of dimensions 1024 $\times$ 512. The source image is taken on a focal length of 25 mm, while the target is captured on a 50 mm lens. We shall be adding and extending the dataset with time to further aid and improve upon this work.
